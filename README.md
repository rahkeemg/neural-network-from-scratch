# Coding a Neural Network from Scratch in Python
In this project, I will be building a neural network from scratch to better understand the intuition behind the design.

The other day, I came across a really good tutorial on this topic by sentdex and decided to follow along.  At the time of this repository, there are only five videos in the playlist.  I will also be using other resources to go furhter along in this project from scratch, depending on how long it takes for the remainder of the playlist to be fulfilled.
